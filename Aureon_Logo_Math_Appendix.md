# AUREON LOGO — MATHEMATICAL APPENDIX
Symbolic Encoding of the Aureon-IX Emblem

## 1. Purpose
The Aureon emblem is treated as a **symbolic mathematical module** whose geometry encodes:
- invariant families
- transformation symmetries
- operator inversions
- stability fields
- recursive structure used by T*

This appendix formalizes those mappings.

## 2. Glyph Structure Overview
The emblem consists of:
1. **Central Core Node (K₀)**
2. **Four Radial Arms (R₁–R₄)**
3. **Nested Fractal Bands (F₁–F₃)**
4. **Rotational Symmetry Group (G₄)**

These elements are treated as mathematical operators.

---

## 3. Core Node — Kernel Descriptor K₀
K₀ encodes the stable core of the Aureon Transform.

### 3.1 Kernel Condition
K₀ satisfies:
K₀ = T*(K₀)

This defines the **fixed-point structure** of the system.

### 3.2 Gradient Bound
|∂T*/∂x| at K₀ < 1  
ensuring dynamic stability.

---

## 4. Radial Arms — Transformation Operators Rᵢ
Each radial arm corresponds to a fundamental transform:

- R₁ = structural operator A(x)
- R₂ = gradient operator B(∇x)
- R₃ = invariant projection C(I(x))
- R₄ = divergence regulator D(x)

Together:
T*(x) = R₁ + R₂ + R₃  
T#(x) = T*(x) − R₄

These form the **operator family of Aureon**.

---

## 5. Fractal Bands — Recursive Depth Layers Fₖ
Each fractal band represents a depth of recursion.

### 5.1 Band Definition
Fₖ is defined recursively:
Fₖ(x) = T*(Fₖ₋₁(x))

with F₀(x) = x.

These encode **RQML loop depth**.

---

## 6. Symmetry Group — G₄
The emblem has **fourfold rotational symmetry**.

### 6.1 Group Definition
G₄ = {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°}

### 6.2 Symmetry Rule
T*(x) must satisfy:
T*(x) = G₄[T*(x)]

which constrains transformations to symmetry-preserving forms.

---

## 7. Complete Symbolic Mapping
The emblem maps to the full Aureon system as follows:

- K₀ ↔ Kernel Stability  
- R₁–R₄ ↔ Transform Operators  
- F₁–F₃ ↔ Recursive Layers  
- G₄ ↔ Symmetry Constraints  

This defines the emblem as a **valid mathematical object**.

## 8. Canonical Status
This appendix becomes part of the Aureon core instruction set.
