SCOPE: Synthesis & Compression Layer and ONE Canonical Store Role
NOTE: All technical notation preserved verbatim.

## 3. Synthesis and Compression Layer

This is the layer that sits between Aureon’s research outputs and the ONE repository.

### 3.1 Synthesis Pipelines

Inputs:

Experimental results from Aureon (simulations, RQML iterations, causal graphs)

Cross-model comparisons from the External Model Mesh

Historical records already in ONE

Responsibilities:

**Hypothesis Normalization**

Bring diverse hypothesis formats into a unified schema:

Premises

Claim statement

Parameter ranges

Confidence distribution

Link to causal graphs

**Evidence Aggregation**

Link each hypothesis to explicit supporting or refuting Evidence Objects

Compute evidence scores using weighted reliabilities and causal relevance

**Conflict Resolution**

Detect contradictions between new and existing knowledge

Trigger conflict-focused RQML cycles in Aureon

Propose reconciled formulations (e.g., context-dependent truths, conditional statements)

### 3.2 Knowledge Compression and Distillation

Purpose: Avoid bloat and make ONE a highly compressed, query-efficient representation of reality.

Mechanisms:

**Representation Learning Layer**

Multi-scale embeddings: symbolic, semantic, causal, and experimental spaces

Compress results into basis vectors that preserve causal structure

**Schema Evolution Engine**

Automatically proposes updated data schemas when new domains appear

Preserves backward compatibility through typed migrations and adapters

**Redundancy Eliminator**

Identifies near-duplicate facts and merges them

Maintains full lineage so nothing is truly lost, only compressed

Outputs from this layer are “Promotion Candidates” to ONE.

## 4. ONE: Canonical Store API and Structure

### 4.1 Core Data Types in ONE

**Fact Units**
Structured assertions about the world with:

Statement, scope, metadata, uncertainty profile

Citation graph linking to Evidence Objects and experimental runs

**Models and Policies**

Trained models, derived equations, parameter sets

Decision policies, control laws, or protocols

**Causal Graphs**

Stable causal structures with confidence intervals

References to facts, models, and evidence

### 4.2 Access Layers

**Query API**

Symbolic queries (logic-like)

Semantic queries (embedding-based)

Causal queries (interventions, counterfactuals)

**Versioning and Time Travel**

Every write creates a new version

ORIGIN can evaluate changes over time: which new experiments shifted what beliefs

### 4.3 Certification Pipeline

Promotion from Synthesis Layer to ONE requires:

Evidence threshold checks

Bias filters (demographic, ideological, institutional)

External validation options (e.g., human experts, trusted external tools)

SENTINEL approval if risk level is high
