Continue the ORIGIN architecture.

## ChatGPT

ORIGIN as the top-level recursive, self-improving, data-synthesizing system with:

**Aureon Node** as the RQML research and hypothesis engine

**ONE** as the final, validated, bias-filtered, canonical knowledge store

## 1. ORIGIN Layering Overview

Think of ORIGIN as seven cooperating strata:

**Substrate Layer**
Hardware, containers, queues, and observability that everything runs on.

**World I/O Layer (INGRESS / EGRESS)**
Connectors to external data sources and models, plus output channels.

**Research Fabric (Aureon Node)**
RQML loops, hypothesis generation, causal modeling, and experiments.

**Synthesis and Compression Layer**
Structure, compress, de-duplicate, and normalize findings into stable forms.

**Canonical Store (ONE)**
Certified, bias-filtered, versioned knowledge and models.

**Orchestration and Scheduling Kernel (ORIGIN Core)**
Task graph manager, recursive job planner, resource allocator.

**Oversight, Meta-Learning and Governance (SENTINEL)**
Safety, audit, reliability scoring, and self-improvement logic.

Below I define the “new” parts: I/O, Synthesis layer, ORIGIN Core, SENTINEL, and the self-improvement pipeline.
